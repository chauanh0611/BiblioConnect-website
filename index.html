          <div class="row">
            Public libraries have widely been regarded as a source of entertainment and an integral factor in improving community literacy. In a community, Libraries make their presence in people’s everyday life with curated collections of books, unlimited Internet access, research support, and programming. Therefore, understanding their value can have a significant impact on the growth of our communities here in Central New York. In particular, this research project highlights the correlation between education and library usage, as well as demonstrate the libraries' economic values. With the assistance of exploratory data analysis and visualization, this project demonstrates the impact public libraries have on communities in Central New York.

          <div class="row">
            Public libraries have been widely known for its vast offerings of intellectual resources and personal development opportunities. However, funding for public libraries remains a challenge. According to a 2019 report by the New York Library Association, the New York State Legislature has proposed cuts to the State Library Aid program for nine consecutive years. While this attempt has been futile, it shows that the government views public libraries as an expense rather than an investment. Therefore, libraries have felt the need to demonstrate their values through quantifiable measures that link them to social and economic prosperity.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
            Among all the ways to measure a library’s service values, return-on-investment (ROI) proves to be an effective method. ROI allows us to evaluate the efficiency of an investment in a particular asset. In general, ROI calculators will return dollar value estimates of circulation and program services of a library. For my research, I use the calculator provided by the Massachusetts Library Association on two main metrics: circulation and programming. These two metrics best represent the human and social capital values that the libraries offer. By reading books and attending educational programs, citizens may broaden their knowledge and hone their vocational skills, which is crucial to the social and economic advancement of a community. Along with the “Total Capital Income” metric, ROI calculations will represent the libraries’ values. On the other hand, “Total Federal Aid” and “Total Public Sources” will demonstrate the investment value in the libraries.

            <br><br>
            <div class="row">
              For every county in Central New York, the generated value is significantly higher than the funding of public libraries. For instance, in 2018, libraries in Onondaga demonstrated generated values ($742,282) that were nearly three times higher than their funding ($258,505). This means that for every dollar of taxpayer’s money, libraries offer services that are worth as high as $3. For some other counties, the value-investment ratio can be as high as 7 to 1. In 2014, Cortland’s public library value ($707,303) was almost seven times as high as the funding ($97,406). Thanks to this common pattern, we can safely conclude that libraries offer services at a much higher value than the budget they receive. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              On the other hand, when it comes to statistics in each funding/value category, there is no consistent trend. For all counties, while the funding values remained stable, the generated values fluctuated slightly: the values went down slowly from 2014 to 2016, picked up again in 2017, and then experienced a decrease at the end of the period. The same pattern applied to every county, with the exception of Madison county where the funding values recorded a completely downward trend. The highest generated value was recorded in Onondaga at almost $3 million. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              When we break the funding category into total public sources and federal aid, we can easily see that there is a wide discrepancy between public sources and federal aid values (which are mostly $0). The same pattern can be observed in the generated value, with return-on-investment value significantly higher than capital income. For instance, in Oswego in 2018, the federal aid is $0 while the public sources are $258,505. Similarly, while the capital income is only $8,413, the return-on-investment is $733,869. Therefore, it is obvious that public sources and return-on-investment are respectively the two main factors in the funding and generated value category. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              The apparent discrepancy between funding and generated values have successfully demonstrated the values of library services. Not only are public libraries worth US taxpayers’ money but they also make major contributions to their communities. Their values are not strictly financial - they offer our community boundless knowledge and resources regardless of socio-economic status. Therefore, libraries should be viewed as a sound community investment instead of a financial burden on taxpayers or government budgets.

            Public libraries have been an integral part of literacy development and educational growth.People turn to libraries for their curated collections of books, as well as for a quiet environment conducive to study. For children and young adults, libraries also have many programs that aim to promote school readiness and educational development. Perhaps most importantly, libraries offer an environment filled with books, where children can have early literary experiences and thus develop their desire to read. Library programs also offer children a reader community, where they can discuss reading progress with their peers. Additionally, parents who actively bring their children to these programs are more likely to be strongly invested in their children’s educational achievements. By doing this, parents can also establish a stronger relationship with their children through the act of reading.

            3rd grade ELA scores and high school graduation are two most critical milestones in a child’s educational development progress. For this topic, I explore the impact of library programming and circulation on children’s ELA passing rate and high school education attainment. The program attendance and circulation metrics are found in the BiblioConnect dataset. The ELA passing rates and high school graduation rates are retrieved from the New York State Education Department (NYSED) website. The passing rate is the percentage of students who achieve level 2 (proficient) and above in the exam. The correlation between library usage and education outcome category are demonstrated with Kendall’s tau-a values.

            In general, a high correlation between ELA passing rate and library usage means that these library services have a positive impact on children’s reading skill development.

Children still struggling to read at this point may experience difficulty as they matriculate through a school's curriculum. In this way, Libraries provide necessary support for early literacy initiatives.

            In today’s world, a high school diploma is the minimum requirement for many job opportunities. People who have at least a high school diploma have higher-paid jobs than those who don’t. In 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that people with less than a high school diploma have median weekly earnings of $592 and this group bears an unemployment rate of 5.4%. By comparison, people with a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $746 and an unemployment rate of 3.7%.

            All counties in Central New York experienced a relatively stable trend when it comes to high school graduation rates. The graduation rate remained within the 70%-90% range. The correlation between circulation and graduation rate fluctuated from county to county, with the highest tau value at 0.6708204 in Cayuga and lowest at -0.316528 in Madison. On the other hand, the correlation between program attendance and graduation rate is positive for all counties, with the exception of Madison and Onondaga (no correlation). In general, a high correlation between high school graduation and library usage means that these library services have a positive impact on children’s reading skill development.
