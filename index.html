            Public libraries is a wholesome source of entertainment and an integral factor in improving
            community literacy. They enrich people lives with large collections of
            books, unlimited Internet access, support for research, and other events. Understanding the use of these services
            can guide the growth of communities in Central New York.
            Using exploratory data analysis and visualization, we shed light on the impact of public libraries
            on communities in Central New York, demonstrating their educational and economic values.

          <div class="row">
            Despite their intellectual values, public libraries continue to get sidetracked by the government when it comes to funding.
             According to a 2019 report by the New York Library Association, the Cuomo government has been attempting to defund the State Library
             Aid program for nine consecutive years. This attempt, while unsuccessful, shows that the government views public libraries as an
             expense rather than an investment. Therefore, libraries have felt the need to demonstrate their values through quantifiable measures
             that link them to social and economic prosperity.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
             Among all the ways to measure a library’s service values, return-on-investment (ROI) proves to be an effective method. ROI
             allows us to evaluate the efficiency of an investment in a particular asset. In general, ROI calculators will return dollar
             value estimates of circulation and program services of a library.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
             For my research, I use the calculator provided by the
             Massachusetts Library Association on two main metrics: circulation and programming. These two metrics best represent the human
              and social capital values that the libraries offer. By reading books and attending educational programs, citizens may broaden
              their knowledge and hone their vocational skills, which is crucial to the social and economic advancement of a community. Along
              with the “Total Capital Income” metric, ROI calculations will represent the libraries’ values. On the other hand, “Total Federal
              Aid” and “Total Public Sources” will demonstrate the investment value in the libraries.

              For every county in Central New York, the generated value is significantly higher than the funding of public libraries. For
              instance, in 2018, libraries in Onondaga generated a value of $742,282, nearly three times higher than
              their funding ($258,505). This means that for every dollar of taxpayer’s money, libraries offer services that are worth as high
              as $3. For some other counties, the value-investment ratio can be as high as 7 to 1. In 2014, Cortland’s public library value
              ($707,303) was almost seven times higher than its funding ($97,406). We can safely conclude that
              libraries offer services at a much higher value than the budget they receive.
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              On the other hand, when it comes to statistics in each funding/value category, there is no consistent trend. For all counties,
              while the funding values remained stable, the generated values fluctuated slightly: it went down slowly from 2014 to 2016,
              picked up again in 2017, and then decreased at the end. The same pattern applied to every county, with
              the exception of Madison county where the funding values recorded a completely downward trend. The highest generated value was
              recorded in Onondaga at almost $3 million.
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              When we break libraries' funding down to public sources and federal aid, we can easily see a wide
              discrepancy between them (federal aid are mostly $0). The same pattern can be observed in the
              generated value, with return-on-investment value significantly higher than capital income. For instance, in Oswego in 2018,
              the federal aid is $0 while the public sources are $258,505. Similarly, while the capital income is only $8,413, the
              return-on-investment is $733,869. Therefore, it is obvious that public sources and return-on-investment are respectively the
              two main factors in the funding and generated value category.
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              The apparent discrepancy between funding and generated values have successfully demonstrated the values of library services.
              Not only are public libraries worth US taxpayers’ money, they also make major contributions to the development of human
              capital in the US. Their values are not strictly in money - they offer communities boundless knowledge and resources
              regardless of people’ background. Therefore, libraries deserve an increase in budget instead of the cutdown they’ve always
              been threatened with.

            Public libraries is an integral to literacy. People
            turn to libraries for their curated collections of books and quiet environments. For children
            and young adults, libraries also have many exclusive programs that aim to educate and promote school readiness.
             Library programs also offer children a community of readers, which greatly enhances their reading experiences.
             Additionally, parents who actively bring their children to these programs are more likely to be
             invested in their children’s education.

            3rd grade ELA scores and high school graduation are two most critical milestones in a child’s educational development progress.
            For this topic, I explore the impact of library programming and circulation on children’s ELA passing rate and high school
            education attainment. The program attendance and circulation metrics are found in the BiblioConnect dataset. The ELA passing
            rates and high school graduation rates are retrieved from the New York State Education Department (NYSED) website. The passing
            rate is the percentage of students who achieve level 2 (proficient) and above in the exam. The correlation between library usage
            and education outcome category are demonstrated with Kendall’s tau-a values.

            All counties in Central New York share a common trend. While the circulation and program attendance rate remained relatively flat throughout the 5-year period, the ELA passing rate experienced an upward trend until 2017, at which point it decreased significantly. In general, the passing rate stayed within the 50% to 80% range.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
            The correlation between ELA passing rate and circulation rate is relatively weak for all counties, with Cortland and Oswego having a negative correlation. The highest tau value is recorded at 0.3162278 for Cayuga. On the other hand, the correlation between ELA passing rate and program attendance rate is fairly high, with tau values for all counties averaging at about 0.5.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
            In general, a high correlation between ELA passing rate and library usage means that these library services have a positive impact on children’s reading skill development. By third grade, a child should be ready to use their reading skills as a learning tool. Children still struggling to read at this point may experience difficulty to keep up in classes later in the future. Therefore, library services can provide support for children regardless of background to make sure that every child receives the education they need.

The correlation between circulation and graduation rate fluctuated from county to county, with the highest tau value at 0.6708204 in Cayuga and lowest at -0.316528 in Madison. On the other hand, the correlation between program attendance and graduation rate is positive for all counties, with the exception of Madison and Onondaga (no correlation). In general, a high correlation between high school graduation and library usage means that these library services have a positive impact on children’s reading skill development.

            In today’s world, a high school diploma is the minimum requirement for many job opportunities. People who have at least a high school diploma have higher-paid jobs than those who don’t. In 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that people with less than a high school diploma have median weekly earnings of $592 and this group bears an unemployment rate of 5.4%. By comparison, people with a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $746 and an unemployment rate of 3.7%. Educated people can adapt better to a changing economy and constant technological developments.
