          <div class="row">
            Public libraries have widely been regarded as a wholesome source of entertainment and an integral factor in improving 
            community literacy. In a community, they make their presence in people’s everyday life with the curated collection of 
            books, unlimited Internet access, research support, and book events. Therefore, understanding the use of their services 
            can have a significant impact on the growth of our communities here in Central New York. In particular, this research 
            project highlights the correlation between education and library usage, as well as demonstrate the libraries' economic values. 
            With the assistance of exploratory data analysis and visualization, this project shed light on the impact do public libraries 
            have on communities in Central New York.

            In this project, I use the BiblioConnect dataset, which features 49 public libraries in 5 Central New York 
            counties (Cayuga, Cortland, Madison, Onondaga, Oswego). Metrics in this dataset span over 3 main categories: 
            Borrower/Circulation, Program Number/Attendance, Funding/Value. Below is a table listing the metrics for each category.

            Public libraries have been widely known for its vast offerings of intellectual resources and personal development opportunities.
             Despite their apparent human capital values, they continue to get sidetracked by the government when it comes to funding. 
             According to a 2019 report by the New York Library Association, the Cuomo government has been attempting to defund the State Library 
             Aid program for nine consecutive years. While this attempt has been futile, it shows that the government views public libraries as an 
             expense rather than an investment. Therefore, libraries have felt the need to demonstrate their values through quantifiable measures 
             that link them to social and economic prosperity.
          </div><br>
          <div class="row">
             Among all the ways to measure a library’s service values, return-on-investment (ROI) proves to be an effective method. ROI 
             allows us to evaluate the efficiency of an investment in a particular asset. In general, ROI calculators will return dollar 
             value estimates of circulation and program services of a library. For my research, I use the calculator provided by the 
             Massachusetts Library Association on two main metrics: circulation and programming. These two metrics best represent the human
              and social capital values that the libraries offer. By reading books and attending educational programs, citizens may broaden 
              their knowledge and hone their vocational skills, which is crucial to the social and economic advancement of a community. Along 
              with the “Total Capital Income” metric, ROI calculations will represent the libraries’ values. On the other hand, “Total Federal 
              Aid” and “Total Public Sources” will demonstrate the investment value in the libraries.

            <br><br>
            <div class="row">
              For every county in Central New York, the generated value is significantly higher than the funding of public libraries. For 
              instance, in 2018, libraries in Onondaga demonstrated generated values ($742,282) that were nearly three times higher than 
              their funding ($258,505). This means that for every dollar of taxpayer’s money, libraries offer services that are worth as high 
              as $3. For some other counties, the value-investment ratio can be as high as 7 to 1. In 2014, Cortland’s public library value 
              ($707,303) was almost seven times as high as the funding ($97,406). Thanks to this common pattern, we can safely conclude that 
              libraries offer services at a much higher value than the budget they receive. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              On the other hand, when it comes to statistics in each funding/value category, there is no consistent trend. For all counties,
              while the funding values remained stable, the generated values fluctuated slightly: the values went down slowly from 2014 to 2016,
              picked up again in 2017, and then experienced a decrease at the end of the period. The same pattern applied to every county, with 
              the exception of Madison county where the funding values recorded a completely downward trend. The highest generated value was 
              recorded in Onondaga at almost $3 million. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              When we break the funding category into total public sources and federal aid, we can easily see that there is a wide 
              discrepancy between public sources and federal aid values (which are mostly $0). The same pattern can be observed in the 
              generated value, with return-on-investment value significantly higher than capital income. For instance, in Oswego in 2018, 
              the federal aid is $0 while the public sources are $258,505. Similarly, while the capital income is only $8,413, the 
              return-on-investment is $733,869. Therefore, it is obvious that public sources and return-on-investment are respectively the 
              two main factors in the funding and generated value category. 
            </div><br>
            <div class="row">
              The apparent discrepancy between funding and generated values have successfully demonstrated the values of library services. 
              Not only are public libraries worth US taxpayers’ money but they also make major contributions to the development of human 
              capital in the US. Their values are not strictly money values - they offer our community boundless knowledge and resources 
              regardless of people’ background. Therefore, libraries deserve an increase in budget instead of the cutdown they’ve always 
              been threatened with.
